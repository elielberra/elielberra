## 🖥️ Projects

### 🧮 [terminal-app](https://github.com/elielberra/terminal-app)
An interactive web terminal that simulates a Linux-like environment in the browser.
It includes real-time shell output, animations, sound effects, and allows users to explore my portfolio through commands — blending web design, backend, and terminal aesthetics.

### 📝 [note-saver](https://github.com/elielberra/note-saver)
A **comprehensive full-stack monorepo** designed to explore modern **DevOps and infrastructure tooling** through a real working application that manages user notes.  

- It comprises the typical webpage architecture of **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Database**.    
- **Messaging Layer:** **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous log routing and a **Go Consumer** to push logs into **Elasticsearch**.  
- **Search & Observability:** Elasticsearch for indexing, **Kibana** for visualization, **Prometheus** and **Alertmanager** for metrics and alerting.  
- **Orchestration & Deployment:** Full support for **Docker Compose**, **Minikube**, and **Amazon EKS**, with manifests and **Helm charts** to deploy microservices consistently.  
- **Automation:** Bash scripts for local setup, SSL generation, namespace creation, and DNS configuration; **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines that build and publish Docker and Helm images automatically.  
- **Monitoring:** Custom alert rules detect pod failures or readiness issues in Kubernetes.  
- **Development Environment:** Includes **Vagrant** provisioning for consistent VM-based environments and **Git Hooks** to enforce code style and pre-push checks.  

This project demonstrates a realistic **infrastructure-as-code** workflow — showing how multiple cloud-native tools integrate in a single monorepo to achieve observability, scalability, and maintainability.
